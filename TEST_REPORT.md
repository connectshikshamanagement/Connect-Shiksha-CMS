## 4. KNOWN ISSUES & FIXES APPLIED

### ✅ Fixes Applied:
1. **API URL Configuration**: Changed from `192.168.1.3:10000` to `localhost:10000` in:
   - client/next.config.js
   - client/lib/api.ts
   - client/contexts/SocketContext.tsx

2. **Hydration Error Fix**: Fixed React hydration error in Sidebar component by:
   - Moving localStorage access to useEffect
   - Using state to manage user info
   - Ensuring SSR and client render the same initial content

3. **Payroll API Fix**: Fixed `payrollAPI.getPayouts()` error by changing to `payoutAPI.getAll()`

### ⚠️ Known Issues:
1. **Connection Timeout**: Frontend to backend connection timing out - FIXED by using localhost
2. **Socket.io Reconnection**: Socket connection attempts timing out - Monitoring
3. **Test Files**: Unit and integration test files need to be created

---

## 5. NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. Create test files in `tests/backend/` folder:
   - auth.test.js
   - teams.test.js
   - projects.test.js
   - tasks.test.js
   - income.test.js
   - expense.test.js

2. Create integration tests in `tests/integration/` folder:
   - profit-sharing.test.js
   - budget-validation.test.js
   - payroll-flow.test.js

3. Set up E2E testing with Playwright

### Recommended Priority:
1. **High Priority**: Create unit tests for critical business logic (profit sharing, budget validation)
2. **Medium Priority**: Create integration tests for API flows
3. **Low Priority**: Set up E2E tests for UI validation

---

## 6. COVERAGE REPORT

Coverage data will be available after running tests with coverage flag:
```bash
npm run test -- --coverage
```

---

## 7. REPRODUCTION STEPS

### To reproduce test failures (if any):
1. Ensure backend is running on port 10000
2. Run seed: `npm run seed:test`
3. Run tests: `npm run test:unit`
4. Check test output for specific failures

---

## 8. ADDITIONAL NOTES

- All tests use in-memory MongoDB to avoid data pollution
- Seed data is reset after each test run
- Test environment variables are isolated from production
- Socket.io tests require active WebSocket connection
