# Payroll Logic Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Profit Sharing Logic (`utils/projectProfitSharing.js`)
**Issue:** Team managers were eligible for profit sharing from ALL projects, regardless of their participation.

**Fixed:** Now team managers are only eligible if they are part of the project (same as team members).

**Key Change:**
```javascript
// Before: Included ALL active team managers
const eligibleManagers = await User.find({
  roleIds: { $in: [managerRole._id] },
  active: true
});

// After: Only include managers who are part of the project
const eligibleManagers = await User.find({
  _id: { $in: project.projectMembers },  // ✅ Added this filter
  roleIds: { $in: [managerRole._id] },
  active: true
});
```

### 2. Updated Team Manager Role Permissions

**Changed Files:**
- `seed/seed.js`
- `scripts/updateRoleSystem.js`

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
finance: { create: false, read: false, update: false, delete: false }, // Hide finance, products, and sales
payroll: { create: false, read: true, update: false, delete: false }, // Show payroll
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Team managers can create/delete projects and tasks
- ✅ Team managers can see Payroll
- ❌ Team managers CANNOT see Finance, Products, or Sales (hidden from sidebar)

### 3. Updated Team Member Finance Routes (`routes/teamMemberFinanceRoutes.js`)
**Issue:** Logic was using hardcoded founder ID and not properly calculating profit shares.

**Fixed:** Now properly finds the founder and divides 30% equally among eligible team members and managers.

**Key Change:**
```javascript
// Properly find founder
const Role = require('../models/Role');
const founderRole = await Role.findOne({ key: 'FOUNDER' });
const founder = await User.findOne({ 
  roleIds: { $in: [founderRole._id] },
  active: true 
});

// Calculate share per person for 30% split
const sharePerPerson = eligibleCount > 0 ? teamShare / eligibleCount : 0;
```

## Profit Sharing Logic (Final)

### Distribution Rules:
1. **Founder**: Always gets 70% of every project's profit
2. **Team Managers**: Get equal share of 30% ONLY if they are part of the project
3. **Team Members**: Get equal share of 30% ONLY if they are part of the project

### Example Calculation:
If a project has:
- 1 Founder
- 1 Team Manager (part of project)
- 2 Team Members (part of project)

Total project profit: ₹1,000

Distribution:
- Founder: ₹700 (70%)
- Team Manager: ₹100 (30% ÷ 3 = ₹100)
- Team Member 1: ₹100 (30% ÷ 3 = ₹100)
- Team Member 2: ₹100 (30% ÷ 3 = ₹100)
- **Total**: ₹1,000 ✅

## Team Manager Access Summary

### ✅ Can Access:
- Teams (full access)
- Projects (create, read, update, delete)
- Tasks (create, read, update, delete)
- Payroll (read only)
- Clients (create, read, update, delete)

### ❌ Cannot Access:
- Finance
- Products
- Sales
- Users (read only)
- Reports (read only)

## Next Steps

To apply these changes:

1. **Run the seed script** to update role permissions:
   ```bash
   node seed/seed.js
   ```

2. **Or run the update role script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/updateRoleSystem.js
   ```

3. **Test the changes**:
   - Login as team manager
   - Verify Finance, Products, and Sales are hidden
   - Verify Payroll is visible
   - Verify can create/delete projects and tasks
   - Verify profit sharing only applies to team managers who are part of projects

## Impact

This fix ensures:
- ✅ Team managers only get profit share if they're part of the project
- ✅ Team members only get profit share if they're part of the project
- ✅ Founder always gets 70% of all project profits
- ✅ Team managers can manage projects/tasks but don't see financial data
- ✅ Payroll visibility maintained for team managers
