2. View/create income and expenses
3. View clients and pipeline
4. View payroll and payouts
5. Offline-first sync with SQLite
6. Push notifications (FCM)

---

### **Architecture Decisions**

#### **Form Management Strategy**
- Using native React state for now
- Can migrate to react-hook-form + zod later for complex forms
- Current approach works well for CRUD operations

#### **API Integration Pattern**
```typescript
// Established pattern:
1. Show loading state
2. Display loading toast
3. Call API via api.ts
4. Dismiss loading toast
5. Show success/error toast
6. Refresh data
7. Close modal
```

#### **Component Structure**
```
Page Component
├── Sidebar (navigation)
├── Header (title + actions)
├── Main Content
│   ├── Action Bar (title + create button)
│   ├── Data Grid/List
│   └── Empty State
└── Modal(s) for CRUD
    └── Form with validation
```

---

### **Performance Considerations**

1. **Implemented:**
   - HTTP 304 caching (already working)
   - Conditional rendering
   - Loading states

2. **To Add:**
   - Pagination for large lists
   - Virtualization for very long lists
   - Debouncing for search/filter
   - Optimistic UI updates

---

### **Testing Strategy**

**Manual Testing Done:**
- ✅ Teams CRUD fully tested
- ✅ Modal open/close
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Toast notifications
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling

**Automated Testing (To Add):**
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- E2E tests with Playwright
- API integration tests
