# Founder Auto-Assignment Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Teams - Auto-Add Founder
**File:** `client/app/dashboard/teams/page.tsx`

When creating a new team, founder is automatically checked/included in team members.

```javascript
const resetForm = () => {
  // Auto-add founder to members when creating new team
  const founder = users.find((user: any) => 
    user.roleIds && user.roleIds.some((role: any) => role.key === 'FOUNDER')
  );
  
  setFormData({
    // ...
    members: founder ? [founder._id] : [], // Auto-add founder
  });
};
```

### 2. Projects - Auto-Add Founder
**File:** `client/app/dashboard/projects/page.tsx`

When creating/updating projects, founder is automatically included in project members to ensure they get 70% profit sharing.

```javascript
// Ensure founder is included in project members (auto-check)
const founderId = founder?._id || founder?.id;
const memberIds = new Set(formData.projectMembers);

// Auto-add founder if not already included
if (founderId && !memberIds.has(founderId)) {
  memberIds.add(founderId);
}

const projectData = {
  ...formData,
  projectMembers: Array.from(memberIds) // Ensure founder is always included
};
```

## Delete Confirmations

All delete buttons already have confirmation dialogs across the website:

- ✅ Teams: "Are you sure you want to delete this team?"
- ✅ Projects: "Are you sure you want to delete this project? This will also delete all associated tasks."
- ✅ Members: "Are you sure you want to delete this user?"
- ✅ Tasks: "Are you sure you want to delete this task?"
- ✅ Clients: "Are you sure you want to delete this client?"
- ✅ Products: "Are you sure you want to delete this product?"
- ✅ Expenses: "Are you sure you want to delete this expense?"

## How It Works

### Teams:
1. When you click "Create Team"
2. Founder is automatically added to members list
3. Checkbox is automatically checked

### Projects:
1. When you select project members
2. Founder is automatically included (even if not checked)
3. Ensures founder always gets 70% profit share

## Benefits

- ✅ Founder never forgotten in teams/projects
- ✅ Automatic 70% profit share for founder
- ✅ Safe deletion with confirmation dialogs
- ✅ No accidental data loss
