## 📊 Profit Sharing Formula

### With Project Owner (Standard Case)
```
Total Profit: ₹25,000

Distribution:
- Founder (70%): ₹17,500
- Owner Bonus (3%): ₹750
- Remaining Pool (27%): ₹6,750

If 2 non-founder members (including owner):
- Project Owner: ₹3,375 (base) + ₹750 (bonus) = ₹4,125
- Other Member: ₹3,375

Total: ₹17,500 + ₹4,125 + ₹3,375 = ₹25,000 ✅
```

### Calculation Steps:
1. **Founder Share**: 70% of total profit
2. **Owner Bonus**: 3% of total profit (from the 30% pool)
3. **Remaining Pool**: 27% of total profit
4. **Base Share per Member**: Remaining pool ÷ number of non-founder members
5. **Project Owner Total**: Base share + Owner bonus

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Fields

**Payroll Model:**
```javascript
{
  isProjectOwner: Boolean,    // Is this user the project owner?
  ownerBonus: Number,         // Owner bonus amount (3% of profit)
  profitShare: Number,        // Base share + owner bonus
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Project Model:**
```javascript
{
  ownerId: ObjectId,          // Required - The project owner
  projectMembers: [ObjectId], // All project members
  memberDetails: [{           // Detailed tracking
    userId: ObjectId,
    joinedDate: Date,
    leftDate: Date,
    isActive: Boolean
  }]
}
```

### Calculation Logic

```javascript
// Get project owner
const projectOwner = await User.findById(project.ownerId);

// Calculate shares
const founderShare = profit * 0.70;
const ownerBonus = profit * 0.03;
const remainingPool = profit * 0.27;

// Split remaining pool equally
const sharePerPerson = remainingPool / nonFounderCount;

// Assign shares
for (user in eligibleUsers) {
  if (user.isFounder) {
    user.share = founderShare;
  } else if (user.id === projectOwner.id) {
    user.share = sharePerPerson + ownerBonus;  // Base + Bonus
  } else {
    user.share = sharePerPerson;
  }
}
```

   - Required field in Project model
   - Cannot be null or empty
   - Change owner by updating `ownerId`

3. **Founder vs Owner**
   - Founder always gets 70%
   - Owner gets base share + 3% bonus
   - Owner can also be founder (rare case)

4. **Historical Records**
   - Old payroll records remain unchanged
   - Re-compute updates to new formula
   - Work duration tracked from join date

## 🔄 Migration
