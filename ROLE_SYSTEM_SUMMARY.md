## 🔧 How to Apply Changes

1. Run the seed script to create/update roles and users:
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

2. Login with the appropriate credentials for each role

3. Test the permissions to ensure the role-based access is working correctly

## 📝 Notes

- All old roles have been removed
- The founder user is preserved
- Team Manager and Team Member users are automatically created
- The frontend `usePermissions` hook already supports these roles
- Role-based UI elements will automatically show/hide based on permissions
