# 📅 Member Join Date Selection Feature

## Overview
Added the ability to set custom joining dates for each team member when creating or updating projects. These dates are automatically used in profit sharing calculations to ensure fair distribution based on actual contribution period.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Join Date Selection in Project Form**
When creating or updating a project, you can now:
- Select individual team members from a list
- Set a specific joining date for each selected member
- See a date picker for each member (except the Founder, whose date is auto-set to project start)

### 2. **Smart Default Dates**
The system intelligently sets default joining dates:
- **New Members**: Defaults to project start date or today's date
- **Founder**: Automatically set to project start date (cannot be changed)
- **Existing Members**: Retains their original join date when editing

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
- Each member has their own date picker in a clean, organized card layout
- Founder's date picker is disabled with a clear note: "(auto-set to project start)"
- Gray background for each member card makes it easy to distinguish
- Increased height for better scrolling through large member lists

## 🎯 How It Works

### Frontend Flow

**When Creating a Project:**
```
1. User selects project members (checkboxes)
   ↓
2. For each selected member, a date picker appears
   ↓
3. Default date is set to project start date or today
   ↓
4. User can modify the date for each member
   ↓
5. On submit, all member IDs and their join dates are sent to backend
```

**When Editing a Project:**
```
1. System fetches project details including memberDetails
   ↓
2. Existing join dates are loaded into the date pickers
   ↓
3. User can modify dates or add/remove members
   ↓
4. On submit, updated dates are saved
```

### Backend Flow

**Data Processing:**
```
Frontend sends:
{
  ...projectData,
  projectMembers: ['userId1', 'userId2', 'userId3'],
  memberJoinDates: {
    'userId1': '2025-10-01',
    'userId2': '2025-10-15',
    'userId3': '2025-10-20'
  }
}

Backend receives and processes:
1. Project.create() or Project.findByIdAndUpdate()
   ↓
2. Pre-save hook triggered
   ↓
3. For each member in projectMembers:
   - Check if memberDetail exists
   - If new: Create with joinedDate from memberJoinDates
   - If existing: Update joinedDate if different
   ↓
4. Save to database with memberDetails array
```

## 📊 Impact on Profit Sharing

### Date-Based Calculations
The join dates are used in `utils/projectProfitSharing.js` to:

1. **Filter Income Records**
   ```javascript
   memberIncomeQuery.date = {
     $gte: memberJoinedDate,
     $lte: endDate
   };
   ```

2. **Filter Expense Records**
   ```javascript
   memberExpenseQuery.date = {
     $gte: memberJoinedDate,
     $lte: endDate
   };
   ```

3. **Calculate Working Days**
   ```javascript
   const workDuration = Math.ceil((endDate - memberJoinedDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) + 1;
   ```

4. **Determine Profit Share**
   - Only income/expenses from join date onwards are considered
   - Each member's share is calculated based on their active period
   - Founder always gets 70% from total project profit (not date-filtered)

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Before:
```
☐ User 1
☐ User 2
☐ User 3
```

### After:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ ☐ User 1                         │
│   Joining Date                   │
│   [  10/01/2025  ]              │
└──────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ ☑ User 2                         │
│   Joining Date                   │
│   [  10/15/2025  ]              │
└──────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ ☑ Admin — Founder                │
│   Joining Date (auto-set)        │
│   [  10/01/2025  ] (disabled)   │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Visual Elements:
- **Gray background** (`bg-gray-50`) for each member card
- **Increased max height** from `max-h-40` to `max-h-96` for better scrolling
- **Date picker** appears only for selected members
- **Disabled state** for Founder with explanatory text
- **Spacing** between cards (`space-y-3`) for clarity

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. **`client/app/dashboard/projects/page.tsx`**

**Added State:**
```typescript
const [memberJoinDates, setMemberJoinDates] = useState<Record<string, string>>({});
```

**Updated Member Selection UI:**
- Changed from simple checkbox list to card-based layout
- Added date picker for each selected member
- Implemented auto-population of join dates

**Updated Form Submission:**
```typescript
const projectData = {
  ...formData,
  projectMembers: Array.from(memberIds),
  memberJoinDates: memberJoinDates // NEW: Include join dates
};
```

**Updated handleEdit:**
- Fetches existing join dates from `memberDetails`
- Populates `memberJoinDates` state
- Displays in date pickers for editing

**Updated resetForm:**
- Clears `memberJoinDates` state when form is reset

#### 2. **`models/Project.js`**

**Added Field:**
```javascript
memberJoinDates: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed,
  select: false  // Not persisted to DB, only used during processing
}
```

**Updated Pre-Save Hook:**
```javascript
// Priority for join date:
// 1. memberJoinDates from frontend
// 2. Project start date (if new project)
// 3. Current date (fallback)

if (this.memberJoinDates && this.memberJoinDates[memberId]) {
  joinDate = new Date(this.memberJoinDates[memberId]);
} else if (this.isNew) {
  joinDate = this.startDate || new Date();
} else {
  joinDate = new Date();
}
```

**Added Update Logic:**
```javascript
// Update existing member's join date if provided
if (this.memberJoinDates && this.memberJoinDates[memberId]) {
  const newJoinDate = new Date(this.memberJoinDates[memberId]);
  if (existingDetail.joinedDate.getTime() !== newJoinDate.getTime()) {
    existingDetail.joinedDate = newJoinDate;
    console.log(`✅ Updated join date for member ${memberId}: ${newJoinDate.toLocaleDateString()}`);
  }
}
```

3. **Update Existing Member Dates**
   - Edit the date in the date picker
   - Changes will be saved on submit

4. **Remove Members**
   - Uncheck member's checkbox
   - They'll be marked as `inactive` with a `leftDate`

5. **Submit**
   - Click "Update Project"
   - Changes are saved

## ✅ Validation & Error Handling

### Frontend Validation
- Date pickers use HTML5 `type="date"` for built-in validation
- Default dates ensure no empty values
- Founder's date is always set (cannot be empty)

### Backend Validation
- Pre-save hook ensures all members have a join date
- Falls back to project start date or current date if missing
- Logs all member additions/updates to console

### Error Scenarios

**Scenario 1: No Date Provided**
- **Fallback**: Uses project start date (new) or today (existing)
- **User Impact**: None, date is auto-set

**Scenario 2: Invalid Date Format**
- **Handling**: Mongoose converts to Date object
- **User Impact**: None, handled automatically

**Scenario 3: Join Date After Project End**
- **Current Behavior**: Allowed (no validation)
- **Future Enhancement**: Could add validation if needed

## 🔐 Permissions

### Who Can Set Join Dates?
- **Founders**: Can create/edit any project and set all join dates

## 📊 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Member Joins Mid-Project

**Project Details:**
- Start Date: 01/10/2025
- Income: ₹100,000 (₹50k in Oct, ₹50k in Nov)
- New member joins: 15/10/2025

**Profit Calculation:**
- Founder: Gets 70% from ₹100k = ₹70,000
- New Member: Only counts income from 15/10 onwards
  - October income (from 15th): ~₹25,000
  - November income: ₹50,000
  - Total for member: ₹75,000
  - Share: Percentage of ₹75k profit

### Scenario 2: Backdating a Member

**Situation:**
- Member was added to project but not in system
- Actual join date was 01/10/2025
- Added to system on 20/10/2025

**Solution:**
1. Edit project
2. Find member in list
3. Set join date to 01/10/2025
4. Save
5. Recompute profit sharing
6. Member now gets correct share from 01/10

### Scenario 3: Founder Auto-Addition

**What Happens:**
- Create new project with start date 01/10/2025
- Add 2 team members with dates 01/10 and 15/10
- Don't manually select Founder

**Result:**
- Founder is auto-added
- Founder's join date = 01/10/2025 (project start)
- All 3 members have correct dates

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Date Format
- Frontend displays: MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY (browser-dependent)
- Backend stores: ISO Date format (2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z)
- Always use local timezone

### Founder Exception
- Founder's profit (70%) is calculated from **total** project income
- NOT filtered by Founder's join date
- Other members' shares ARE filtered by their join dates

### Join Date Priority
1. **Explicitly set via UI** (highest priority)
2. **Project start date** (for new projects)
3. **Current date** (fallback)

### Updating Dates
- Can update join dates anytime
- Must click "Compute Profit Sharing" after updates
- Previous payroll records are not automatically updated

## 🔄 Migration for Existing Projects

If you have existing projects without custom join dates:

**Option 1: Manual Update**
1. Edit each project
2. Verify/update member join dates
3. Save changes

**Option 2: Bulk Update Script**
Use `scripts/setMemberJoinDate.js` to update specific members:
```javascript
const memberEmail = 'user@example.com';
const projectTitle = 'Project Name';
const joinDate = new Date('2025-10-01');
// Run script
```

**Option 3: Keep Defaults**
- Existing members will use project start date
- Only update if specific date needed

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Join dates not showing in edit mode
**Solution**: Ensure backend populates `memberDetails` when fetching project

### Issue: Profit share still using wrong dates
**Solution**: Click "Compute Profit Sharing" button after updating dates

### Issue: Founder's date is wrong
**Solution**: Update project start date - Founder's date will auto-update

### Issue: Date picker shows wrong format
**Solution**: This is browser-dependent, dates are saved correctly regardless
